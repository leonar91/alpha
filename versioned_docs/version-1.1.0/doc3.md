Once Docker is fully installed and running. Open a terminal on your device and type the commands.

``` docker volume create alpha-video ```


``` docker run -d --restart unless-stopped --name alpha-video -v alpha-video:/data -p 5000:5000 -p 9001:9001 -e localtunnel=false andrewstech/alpha-video:latest ```


That command downloads the latest version of the code and runs it in a virtual environment.

It should start downloading multiple files and give you an output such as ``` 3493783796b56777987287120c5e3d4defa418d58825d22aa7b1a7c96dfa6604 ```. This means the code has been installed. Now we need to see our endpoint domain.

Run ``` docker logs ``` followed by the number you just copyed. For example ``` docker logs 3493783796b56777987287120c5e3d4defa418d58825d22aa7b1a7c96dfa6604 ```.

This should show the logs of the skill and at the bottom you should see the line ``` Your public URL for accessing your local service ``` Followed by the url.

Copy this down as you will need this later.
